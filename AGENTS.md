## Changes (YASS)
Planned work lives in the yass folder's `changes/`, one dated folder per change: `yass/` in the repo, or wherever `yass.yaml` points (`yass root` prints it; see its README.md). CLI: `yass`, on your PATH. Playbooks: the `yass-*` skills, in `.agents/skills/` or your user skills folder.
- `yass status` shows what's in flight. If `yass root` is outside this repo, plans and code are committed separately: see "Plans in another folder" in `yass-work`. Work only on the change you're pointed at (unless you've been put in charge of choosing), and resume it from the last **Next:** in its Log. `not started` means planned but not built yet; its plan may still need approval.
- As you work, mark boxes `[/]` when you start them and `[x]` when they're verified, and append to `## Log` and `## Decisions` alongside the code.
- Intent (`prd.md`, `design.md`, plan text, a Goal, acceptance criteria, including dropping one with `[-]`) never changes in the same commit as code, so decisions can be reviewed apart from execution. If the plan is wrong mid-build, put the fix on its own branch underneath the code and rebase onto it (see `yass-work`), or stop and say so.
- Don't commit, branch or rebase unless you've been given that latitude; otherwise show the human the git commands.
- A plan from plan mode can become a change: `yass-shape` for large work, `yass-plan` or `yass-work` for small.
- Never edit the archive (`archive/` in the yass folder). Follow-up work is a new change with `follows: <archived folder>`.
- Finished means every box is checked; then `yass archive <change>`, in its own commit.
