# The playbooks

YASS ships five playbooks, as [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) in [`kit/.agents/skills/`](../kit/.agents/skills). `install.sh` copies them to `.agents/skills/` in your repo (project scope), and `--claude` also copies them to `.claude/skills/`. With `--global`, they go in your user folder instead. Agents pick one by matching your request against its `description`.

This page is an index for reviewing what each playbook lets an agent do. The `SKILL.md` files are the source of truth; if this page and a playbook disagree, the playbook wins and this page needs fixing.

| Playbook | Mode | Use it for | Writes files | Waits for a human |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`yass-shape`](../kit/.agents/skills/yass-shape/SKILL.md) | conversation | a new feature, component or system; a harness plan to save; revising a PRD | `prd.md`, `change.md` | to pick a scope, and to approve the PRD |
| [`yass-plan`](../kit/.agents/skills/yass-plan/SKILL.md) | mostly automated | approach, acceptance criteria, pieces; a harness plan to save; revising a plan | `plan.md`, `design.md`, pieces | no; asks only about real choices the PRD leaves open |
| [`yass-work`](../kit/.agents/skills/yass-work/SKILL.md) | attended or unattended | building the one change it's pointed at | code, progress sections, stacked intent fixes | when it isn't pointed at a change, or isn't confident a plan fix is right |
| [`yass-status`](../kit/.agents/skills/yass-status/SKILL.md) | report | "where are we?" | nothing | no; it lists what needs one |
| [`yass-log`](../kit/.agents/skills/yass-log/SKILL.md) | report | "why did we…?", "why does this code…?", release notes, retros | nothing | no |

The usual flow is (plan mode →) shape → plan → work, with `yass-status` along the way and `yass-log` whenever someone asks why. Small changes skip straight to `yass-work`. Each step ends where the next begins: shaping never plans, planning never builds.

**Starting work.** `yass-work` only builds a change it's been pointed at, by name or because the session is already on it. It never picks one because it's in progress. Boxes are `[ ]` not started, `[/]` in progress, `[x]` done, `[-]` dropped. `yass status` marks changes with no Log entry and no box in progress or done as `not started`, and changes whose boxes are all done or dropped as `done`; shaping and planning write neither, so a freshly planned change stays `not started` until someone starts it. In a fully autonomous run, where the harness or human has put the agent in charge, the agent makes that choice and any approvals itself, and records them in Decisions.

**Git.** No playbook commits on its own initiative, and none pushes, merges or opens pull requests. Only `yass-work` touches git, and only to stack an intent fix under the code, when the human or the harness has given it that latitude; otherwise it hands the human the commands. The CLI never touches git. What a good commit looks like (intent apart from code) is in the README rules, the `AGENTS.md` section and the optional hook.

**Plan mode.** `yass-shape`, `yass-plan` and `yass-work` can each start from a plan the harness's plan mode produced, carrying over its decisions instead of asking again, and telling the human what they added beyond it.

## yass-shape

A conversation where a human decides what to build and why. Turns a problem, or an approved harness plan, into a large change with a PRD, and stops there. Also revises the PRD of an active change.

- **Reads:** a harness plan if there is one; the relevant code and docs; the archive (`yass status --archived`) for earlier work; `yass status` for overlapping work.
- **Runs:** `yass new "<title>" --large [--source …] [--follows …]`.
- **Writes:** `prd.md` (why, users and outcomes, requirements `R1…`, non-goals, milestones, open questions); the Goal and `## Decisions` in `change.md`, crediting the human for choices made in their plan. A revision also records its reason in Decisions.
- **Human gates:** picks among 2–3 scoping options for non-trivial problems, unless the plan already picked; shows the PRD and waits for a go-ahead before planning, *unless your team has told it otherwise*, or a fully autonomous run has put it in charge of approvals (it records that in Decisions). From an approved plan, it points out only what it added. Tells a human about revisions.
- **Never:** mixes code into PRD edits; edits an archived change (new intent is a new change with `--follows`).

## yass-plan

Mostly automated: turns an approved PRD into the how (approach, acceptance criteria, design calls, PR-sized pieces) without a back-and-forth, and stops at a written plan. The change stays `not started` until someone points `yass-work` at it. Also revises a plan when reality disagrees.

- **Reads:** a harness plan if there is one (checked against the code and PRD, not redone); the change's `prd.md`, the code it touches, its docs. With no change folder yet, hands large work to `yass-shape` and creates small work itself.
- **Runs:** `yass new "<piece>" --in <change> [--goal …]`; `yass new … --design`, or `yass template design` for an existing change.
- **Writes:** `plan.md` (approach, `AC1 (R1) Given … — verify: …` per milestone, piece order, validation); `design.md` for hard-to-undo calls (at least two options, who decided); each piece's `change.md`, naming the criteria it delivers. Turns a harness plan's steps into real criteria rather than relabeling them.
- **Human gates:** asks only when the PRD leaves a real choice open. Tells a human about any revision, and calls out reworded, removed or dropped criteria as lowering the bar. Doesn't wait for approval of a new plan.
- **Never:** mixes code into plan edits. A revision during a build goes underneath the code (see `yass-work`).

## yass-work

Builds the one change it's pointed at and keeps its progress next to the code. Also runs unattended: one change (or piece) per run, stopping instead of asking.

- **Picks:** only the change named in the request, or the one the session is already on. Otherwise it shows `yass status` and asks (unattended: stops). When it's been put in charge of choosing, it picks, checks or gives the plan's approval, and records both in Decisions.
- **Reads:** the change's `change.md` from the last **Next:** in its Log; for a piece, the parent's `prd.md` and `plan.md`; the code and docs it touches.
- **Runs:** `yass status [<change>]`; `yass new "<title>" [--source …]` for a small, clear request (from a harness plan, if there is one); `yass archive <change>` when the change is `done`.
- **Writes:** code; boxes marked `[/]` when started and `[x]` when verified (Steps, Acceptance, and plan criteria the work delivers); `## Decisions`; `## Steps`; a `## Log` entry before stopping. For a new small change, its Goal and Acceptance.
- **When the plan is wrong:** reasons out the fix. Not confident: sets `blocked:` and stops. Confident: puts the intent edit on its own branch from the work's base, with the reason in Decisions, rebases the work on top, and keeps going. Lowering the bar is stacked the same way but flagged as needing a human before merge.
- **Plans in another folder** (`yass root` outside the repo): cites the code commits a box rests on (`— code: a1b2c3d`), marks it `[x]` only once that code is merged, and puts intent changes in the plans' own repo, linked from the code PR. `yass status` checks the citations.
- **Git:** only for that stack, and only with latitude from the human or harness (plain `git`, or `gh stack` and similar). Attended without latitude: shows the commands. Unattended without latitude: leaves the edits, writes the commands into the Log's **Next:**, and stops.
- **Never:** changes intent alongside code; builds out-of-scope work (it notes it in the Log or the repo's issue tracker); marks a box `[x]` without evidence from its `verify:`.

## yass-status

A one-screen report, then a list of what needs a human. Read-only.

- **Reads:** `yass status`, then `yass status <change>` for every change that's been started (for its `[/]` items, and blocked or nearly done detail); `git log --since=<date>` over each folder `yass root` prints, and Log entries since then (it asks since when, or uses a week); recent decisions, the way `yass-log` finds them.
- **Reports:** progress per change (in progress apart from `not started`), blocked changes and why, recent decisions with who made them, changes ready to archive, stale changes, and intent revisions stacked under work in progress.
- **Then lists:** each item that needs a human, with the playbook or command that handles it, and one suggested next move. It acts on none of them.

## yass-log

Reconstructs decisions from the files and git, and links them to code through `code:` citations. Read-only.

- **Reads:** `## Decisions` in every yass folder `yass root` prints (in the repo, team folders, or wherever `yass.yaml` points) via `grep`; `git log` for when and who, `git log -S` for the commit that added a line, `git log -p` for how a PRD or plan changed; the commits boxes cite, from the code repo (date, author, subject, merged or not); Goal, PRD and Log for context. Can start from code instead: a file's or symbol's commits, searched for in the plans' `code:` citations.
- **Reports:** newest first, grouped by change, with the cited code under each decision, citing file paths and commit shas (and which repo each sha is from). Flags decisions with no author, and moved goalposts: intent edits in the same commit as code when the plans are in the repo; acceptance criteria reworded or dropped after their code's box was marked `[x]` when they're in another folder.
- **Plans in another folder:** runs git for the plans with `git -C <folder> … -- .` (the folder may share a repo) and for the code here. With no git history, dates decisions only approximately, from the Log headings around them, and says so.
- **Never:** infers a decision that isn't written down; it says when the record is silent.
