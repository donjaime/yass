source: Jaime, 2026-10-04: installing the binary and setting up a repo are two steps that install.sh does as one, which confuses; noted while fixing the install docs (follows-up 2026-10-04-install-say-where-to-run-it-and-how-yass)

# The binary carries the playbooks

## Goal
<!-- Intent. One paragraph; the detail is in prd.md (why and what) and plan.md (how and acceptance). -->
Using YASS takes two steps that each say what they do: get the `yass` binary, once per machine, and run `yass init` in each repo. The binary carries the playbooks and the hook for its version, so `yass init` sets up a whole repo, or a monorepo folder with its own agent files, with no release download, `yass upgrade` brings every copy in the repo up to the binary's version (or says it's already up to date), and a teammate joining a repo needs only the binary. The one-line install runs both, `install.sh` and then `yass init`. Every file YASS installs records the version that wrote it, and `yass status` says when the binary and the repo are out of step.

## Decisions
<!-- Progress. "- <decision> - <why> (<who>)" for calls that span the whole change. -->
- Noted as a future large change rather than built now - it changes the CLI, `install.sh` and the release; the install docs were fixed first, explaining the two steps instead of splitting them (Jaime)
- Scope: `yass init` does the whole repo setup from the binary, re-running it upgrades, the repo records its YASS version, and `install.sh` becomes a binary installer; Homebrew and self-update, and a minimal `install.sh`-modes version, were considered and left out (Jaime)
- The one-line install keeps working: it installs the binary, then runs `yass init` (with any setup flags) when run in or pointed at a repo, and says which step did what (Jaime) - superseded below
- Versions live in the files YASS installs: the binary carries its version, the playbooks have it in their frontmatter, the `AGENTS.md` section in its markers (and the hook script in a header), and `yass init` reads them to decide what to do. That also covers playbooks installed with `--global` (Jaime; the hook header added by claude)
- `yass init` is idempotent and does the upgrade itself: no `--upgrade` flag. It detects an upgrade and says so, and says "already up to date" when there's nothing to do (Jaime) - superseded below
- `yass init` never downgrades: newer files than the binary mean upgrade the binary (claude, for review)
- The monorepo change's `yass-trailers` piece waits for this change and ships its hook scripts through `yass init` (Jaime)
- Builds from a clone carry the release they follow plus a commit, and `+dirty`; a `+dirty` build rewrites files stamped with its own version, and a newer release upgrades over a clone build (Jaime). Versions compare as SemVer, with Go's pseudo-versions for clone builds (claude; design.md §1)
- No edit detection: upgrading replaces YASS's files, and since they're committed, the replacement shows up in `git diff` for review. Hashes, a prompt and `--force` were considered and dropped as more than the problem needs (Jaime). `yass init` lists what it writes and labels files outside version control (`--global` playbooks); unstamped files from v0.1 and v0.2 count as older and get upgraded (claude)
- PRD and design approved 2026-10-04 (Jaime)
- Planned in four pieces: `yass init` writes everything, then upgrades by version, then `install.sh` becomes a binary installer with the docs rewritten, and the `yass status` line (claude)
- `install.sh` runs `yass init` only when given a path (`.` for the repo you're in); without one it installs just the binary (claude, while planning) - superseded below
- Version comparison uses `golang.org/x/mod/semver` (design §4), and building from source needs Go 1.24, so clone builds carry a version (design §5) (claude, while planning; for review)
- `install.sh` only installs the binary; the documented one-liner runs `yass init` itself (`… | bash -s -- --bin-dir ~/.local/bin && ~/.local/bin/yass init`), so `install.sh` stays simple (Jaime). It calls the binary by its full path so it works before PATH is fixed, and `install.sh` given an old-style repo path or setup option installs nothing and prints the two commands instead, so a script expecting repo setup fails loudly rather than half-working (claude)
- An explicit `yass upgrade`: it finds every YASS file from the repo root down (and the user folder's playbooks) and upgrades each by version; `yass init` only sets up, keeping what's there. Upgrade docs live in the README and `docs/install.md`: reinstall the binary, then `yass upgrade` in each repo; not on the landing page (Jaime). Design §6 (claude)
- Agent files per folder: `yass init <folder> --agents` puts the `AGENTS.md` section and the playbooks in that folder for monorepo parts with their own agent setup; the hook stays at the repo root; `yass init <folder>` alone is planning only (Jaime, option 1 of three)
- Revised plan: a new piece 2 for agent files per folder, piece 3 becomes `yass-upgrade` (renamed from `init-upgrades-by-version`), and `install.sh` and status follow; AC23 now covers `yass upgrade` outside git, since `yass init` outside git is supported (claude)
